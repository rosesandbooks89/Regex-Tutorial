# Title (Matching an Email Address-Regex Tutorial)

This tutorial will explain how to match an email address using regex using the expression /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. This can be helpful for validating email addresses in a form or for searching for email addresses in a document or with apps/programs like Node or MongoDB.

## Summary

A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is commonly used for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.
